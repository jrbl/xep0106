"""XEP-0106 is a specification for escaping illegal characters in XMPP
(jabber) node names so that they can be processed by standards-compliant
servers, and for unescaping them so that they can be displayed sensibly.

This library is probably most useful if you're going to glue bits of
Jabber infrastructure together with bits of Python code. For example,
if you're going to embed candy.js into a Django site, and you have a
lot of users who are registered for your service using their email
address as their username, and you implement single sign-on against your
Jabber service.""",
